= IaCStart - Let's move to good old europe

Due to a new regulation requirement it is not longer allowed to run the shop in the US. 

Therefore, you need to delete the resources in the US and to deploy the shop in the AWS region eu-central-1.

HINT: Some of the resources and IDs are region bounded.

From this second on, the revenue from the shop will not count until the shop is available with an EU IP-Address and your user are informed about the move.
